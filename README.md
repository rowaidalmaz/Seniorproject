Anti-drowning system


Anti-drowning system: Smart inflate life jacket connected to a heart rate and oxygen in the blood sensor in a wearable bracelet that will detect swimmers at risk of drowning early, allowing them to rescue the drowning person in a very short time.

The system will track the wearable bracelet while swimming and monitor the vital signs underwater to detect if there is a critical condition in the pool via a dashboard that displays the swimmerâ€™s conditions in real-time. 

When the combined parameters go over the maximum threshold, the red light and buzzer are activated, and the fully automated life jacket will inflate until the person is stable.
